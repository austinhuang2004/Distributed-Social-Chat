For this code I first started by taking the ds_client and ds_protocol back from a4 and put it into this code.
I also added the profile module. I started by first reading the instructions and seeing what had to be added.
I used the code that was given to make a direct message (a function of it) then I added two more functions
for the 'ok' and also for the new and all messages. After that I made a unit test to check it. Then I moved 
on to the ds_client where I removed many of the code that was not necessary anymore and added the class
and functions that were ncessary. I made sure all of the code works through unit test and moved on to part 3
and part 4. For part 3 and 4 I followed the instructions and also the comments in for what to implement and changed
the GUI based on it. After that I used pylint and pycodestyle to check for potential fixes.
